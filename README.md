Overlayed2 Built-in elements ğŸ–¼ğŸ§¦

This repository contains the built in elements that [Overlayed2](https://github.com/bengreenier/overlayed2) references by default. They are authored, tested, and semantically versioned here. The semantically versioned releases are consumed via jsDelivr reference to the GitHub version tag.

## Development

- `npm run build` - to rollup and package each element under `dist/<elementName>.min.js`
- `npm run lint` - to run the linter
- `npm run test` - to run jest (the test runner)
