Overlayed2 Built-in elements ğŸ–¼ğŸ§¦

This repository contains the built in elements that [Overlayed2](https://github.com/bengreenier/overlayed2) references by default. They are authored, tested, and semantically versioned here. The semantically versioned releases are consumed via jsDelivr reference to the GitHub version tag.

The latest version can be found [here](https://github.com/overlayed-app/elements-built-in/releases/latest).

## Development

- `npm run build` - to rollup and package each element under `dist/<elementName>.min.js`
- `npm run lint` - to run the linter
- `npm run test` - to run jest (the test runner)
